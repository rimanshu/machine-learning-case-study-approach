some work from Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach - univ of washington coursera course
https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-foundations

concepts of machine learning like 

* Regression
	* Case : House price prediction (week2)
* Classification
	* Case : Amazon product review - Sentiment analysis (week3)
* Clustering

* Recommender systems
	* Case : Music remmonder system (week5)
* Deep learning - image search
	* Case : Image classification and Image retrieval(week6)
 

 
 
have been studied by case and python code for each using public datasets is implemented.
Python code implemented in "Jupyter notebooks" for ease of use

Note: ipynb files in github do not render images(graphs or other images).
Run locally in jupyter ipython notebook, to open the images
